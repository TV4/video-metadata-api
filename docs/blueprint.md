# Video Metadata API

Video Metadata API is and XML/REST'ish API to communicate video metadata to and from the EMP platform.
Louise/Metabanken (or other sources) send metadata to EMP. Metadata is enriched in EMP and sent to other following systems. E.g., search engine.

Key concept is the separation between content and the publish/schedule. 
Content is detached and independent from the publication and scheduling of the content.

Request **MUST** be over **HTTPS** (strict HTTPS).
Authentication/authorisation is communicated via the `x-api-key` header. (Format of x-api-key to be defined. Alternativees are: basic auth, simple random nonce, or JWT token)

The api will support versioning and multiple versions can co-exsist on the same host. THus the version is in the URL path.
E.g., test URL: https://emp-test.tv4.se/video-metadta-api/v1/contents
